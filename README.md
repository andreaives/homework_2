Andy's Bio 
Description
This website includes a portfolio page, Abut Me page, and a contact page. Each page is designed to be responsive and include boostrap snippets. 

Installation
Fork all of the files over to your own GitHub to make changes. 

Usage
Anybody can download this repo and enter their own information & images.

Technologies Used
The main tech used was JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This code was created on Visual Studio and renders were checked on Google Chrome. FOr some interactive elements such as the NavBar and the cards I used bootstrap snippets. Additionally, I did use some Google Fonts as well.


Problems I faced
My biggest problem with this page was the drop down menu was not responsive upon installation. To fix this issue I had the chage the data-target tag to match the id. I am unsure why Boostrap did not have it set correctly in the first place.


Credits
Most of the credit goes to my Professor, Gary and the two TA's Leo and Maria. I also had some help from my classmates (Jessica, Tessa, Ryan, Taylor and Colby), and my tutor Brian Ford.
