### Technologies Used
The main tech used was JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This code was created on Visual Studio and renders were checked on Google Chrome. FOr some interactive elements such as the NavBar and the cards I used bootstrap snippets. Additionally, I did use some Google Fonts as well.


### Problems I faced
My biggest problem with this page was the drop down menu was not responsive upon installation. To fix this issue I had the change the data-target tag to match the id. I am unsure why Boostrap did not have it set correctly in the first place.
